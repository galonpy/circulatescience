  <h1>Welcome to Circulate</h1>
  <p><strong>Circulate</strong> is a free tool that helps researchers get in contact with scholars who are likely to incorporate your work into their ongoing projects! </p>
  <p>There’s a key window of opportunity—after a peer shares a draft on arXiv but before they finalize their paper—when they’re still shaping their writing and acknowledging related contributions. 
    Circulate helps you identify the <strong> right scholars </strong> at the  <strong> right time</strong> to reach out to about your hard work. </p>

  <h2>Why I made Circulate</h2>
  <p>
    When I created Circulate, I had just published an AI paper to arXiv and wasn't lucky enough to get admitted into a top-tier conference (ICLR).
    Circulate enabled me to quickly reach out to the right researchers by email.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    The positive network effect from using Circulate led to my work receiving a mention in 200+ other papers according to Google Scholar.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Without Circulate, my paper might have remained in the black hole of underutilized arXiv submissions.
    Circulate helped me land Zoom calls with brilliant, energetic researchers in my subfield and also kickstart my career transition into LLM Agents.
  </p>

  <h2>Example Paper</h2>
  <p>
    Here's a paper I used Circulate for:
    <br />
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14132" target="_blank">"Detecting Language Model Attacks with Perplexity"</a>
  </p>

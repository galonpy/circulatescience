  <h1>Welcome to Circulate</h1>
  <p><strong>Circulate</strong> is a free tool that helps researchers (like you) get an email contact list of other published authors who share the same niche interests as your new publication.</p>
  <p>The primary use case is to <strong>increase the readership and usage of your new research paper</strong> by your global peers.</p>

  <h2>Why I made Circulate</h2>
  <p>
    When I created Circulate, I had just published an AI paper to arXiv and wasn't lucky enough to get admitted into a top-tier conference (ICLR).
    Circulate enabled me to quickly reach out to the right researchers by email.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    The positive network effect from using Circulate led to my work receiving a mention in 200+ other papers according to Google Scholar.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Without Circulate, my paper might have remained in the black hole of underutilized arXiv submissions.
    Circulate helped me land Zoom calls with brilliant, energetic researchers in my subfield and also kickstart my career transition into LLM Agents.
  </p>

  <h2>Example Paper</h2>
  <p>
    Here's a paper I used Circulate for:
    <br />
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14132" target="_blank">"Detecting Language Model Attacks with Perplexity"</a>
  </p>

# Circulate

**Circulate** is a free AI engine built to help researchers connect with scholars who are likely to build on or cite their work. 

## 🚀 Why I Built Circulate

When I published an AI paper that didn’t get accepted to a major conference, I still wanted people to read it, use it, and build on it. By reaching out to relevant researchers at the right time, I was able to generate over 200 citations, start collaborations, and even move into working on LLM Agents. Circulate grew out of that experience. I wanted to give other researchers a way to create these same opportunities.

## ✅ What Circulate Does

* Identifies scholars who may incorporate your work into their ongoing research.
* Highlights the ideal moment to reach out.
* Helps increase visibility for important work that might otherwise go unnoticed.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. You share your publication url or pdf to the admin (galon@umich.edu) or to https://circulatescience.com/ (website in construction)
2. Circulate identifies scholars who are likely to engage and share your work.
3. You reach out to the peers who are highly likely to circulate your work.

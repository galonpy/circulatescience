Circulate

Circulate is a free tool designed to help researchers connect with scholars who are likely to build on or cite their work. It focuses on the critical window between posting a draft on arXiv and the final publication stage, when peers are actively shaping their own manuscripts.

🚀 Why Circulate Exists

After publishing an AI paper that wasn’t accepted to a major conference, the creator still wanted the work to be read and used. By emailing relevant researchers at the right moment, they were able to generate more than 200 citations, start new collaborations, and eventually transition into working on LLM Agents. Circulate grew out of this experience as a way to help other researchers achieve similar impact.

# Circulate

**Circulate** is a free AI engine built to help researchers identify scholars who are likely to build on or cite their work. 

## 🚀 Why I Built Circulate

When I published an AI paper that didn’t get accepted to a major conference, I still wanted people to read it, use it, and build on it. By reaching out to relevant researchers at the right time, I was able to generate over 300 citations, start collaborations, and even move into working on LLM Agents. Circulate was built out of this experience to help scholars grow the reach of their ideas globally.

## ✅ What Circulate Does

* Identifies scholars likely to incorporate your work into their upcoming publications.
* Helps increase visibility for your important work
* Helps researchers outperform the average citation count of 4

## 🔧 How It Works

1. You share your publication url or pdf to the admin (galon@umich.edu) or to https://circulatescience.com/ (website in construction)
2. Circulate identifies scholars who are likely to engage and share your work.
3. You reach out to the peers who are highly likely to circulate your work.

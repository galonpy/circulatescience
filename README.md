# Circulate

**Circulate** is a free tool I built to help researchers connect with scholars who are likely to build on or cite their work. It focuses on the crucial window between posting a draft on arXiv and the final publication stage, when peers are actively shaping their manuscripts.

## 🚀 Why I Built Circulate

When I published an AI paper that didn’t get accepted to a major conference, I still wanted people to read it, use it, and build on it. By reaching out to relevant researchers at the right time, I was able to generate over 200 citations, start collaborations, and even move into working on LLM Agents. Circulate grew out of that experience. I wanted to give other researchers a way to create these same opportunities.

## ✅ What Circulate Does

* Identifies scholars who may incorporate your work into their ongoing research.
* Highlights the ideal moment to reach out, when people are writing or revising.
* Helps increase visibility for important work that might otherwise go unnoticed.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. You upload your publication url or pdf
2. Circulate identifies scholars who are likely to engage with your work.
4. You reach out personally to share your contribution and start a conversation.
